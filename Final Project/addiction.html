                 What is Addiction?
                </h2>
				<p>Addiction (also called substance use disorder) is a chronic health condition in which people who take drugs continue taking them despite the negative impact on their health or lives. Individuals with addiction may have a difficult time moving on from drug use on their own. When people with an opioid addiction stop taking opioids, they often get strong urges or cravings for drugs and experience intense muscle aches, nausea and vomiting. These are symptoms of opioid withdrawal. They may continue experiencing strong urges or cravings many months or even years after they stopped using. These symptoms of can lead a person to return to drug use, even after periods of abstinence and despite a strong desire not to.</p>
                <p>Opioid addiction can be treated successfully with medications. These medications can reduce cravings or urges to use drugs, prevent overdose and protect a person’s overall health. Treatment works best when it is tailored to the individual and addresses drug use, as well as other social, emotional and health issues. Similar to other chronic health conditions, people with addiction can have periods where their health condition is not well-controlled and they return to drug use. This is not a sign of weakness or personal failure. Good care often requires adjusting treatment or providing additional support.</p>
